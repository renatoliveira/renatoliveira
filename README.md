# Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Renato

Salesforce Engineer/Developer/Administrator/Architect, 13x certified.

Proudly the first person to (publicly on GitHub) publish a time-based one-time password algorithm in Apex.

I also write other useful things such as [Apex JSON Path](https://github.com/Dogeforce/apex-json-path), the minimum implementation of JSON Path, but in Apex, the [tile wall](https://github.com/Dogeforce/tilewall-lwc) component that you can show in your Lightning Experience record pages and the [Apex Test List](https://github.com/renatoliveira/apex-test-list) CLI tool, that can come in handy in your CI/CD pipelines for Salesforce projects. :)
